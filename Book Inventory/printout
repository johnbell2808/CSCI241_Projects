 Description: The main file that executes and accesses the functions from
 BookInventory.cpp. This project is an improvement of a previous project
 with the use of dynamic arrays. 
 The main function takes creates a BookInventoryobject, 
 reads in the data file, prints the data file, takes menu input from use,
 repeats until user desires to close program, and then writes BookInventory
 to OilerBookList.dat file. Credit goes to Dr. Ringenberg for writing the
 majority of the BookStore.cpp with minimal changes within the main file.

 Input: User enters menu selection, and from there, based on their selection
        they are asked for the information fields to either input info for
a book, or a search which allows them the option to delete the
cheapest book in the array.


 Output: The data read in from the file is displayed for the user to see
         with all string fields converted to upper case. The user is
 continuously printed a menu that allows them to utilize different
 portions of the program. Input fields are specified accordingly.

 Due Date: Monday, February 16th, 2015

 Description: The class file that implements most of the projects functions.
 With most of the original Book class fils/header remaining the same,
 the use of dynamic arrays is being stressed throughout this
 update. A BookInventory class is created, and changes in max
 number of elements allowed in respect to the parameters
 specified (if the number of books entered equals the max,
 the array allocates more space) while the user is
 entering book information specified. The user can sort
 the list of books that is stored, do a search of the
list, and delete the cheapest book, print the list out,
and close the program and write to the output file.

Input:Data is initially read using the ReadFromFile function.
Users enter a menu choice accordingly to the menu given.
The addBook function allows for entering of books and the
corresponding information being prompted. If the book is
not successfully added, the user is notified. This function
keeps track of the number of books in the array as well
as the maximum number of elements. A search query is asked
if the user chooses, and they are also asked if they would
like to delete the cheapest book.

Output: The data read in from the file is displayed for the user to see
with all string fields converted to upper case. The user is
continuously printed a menu that allows them to utilize different
portions of the program. Input fields are specified accordingly.
Functions are primarily derived functions of the previous project,
except output is saved to a file.
